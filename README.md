# ATS Resume Analyzer - AI Powered Career Assistant

An advanced MERN stack application that analyzes resumes using AI (Gemini), provides ATS scores, identifies skill gaps, and suggests personalized career roadmaps.

## 🌟 What Makes This Project Unique?

Unlike standard ATS checkers, this platform provides a **complete end-to-end career solution**:

- **Direct Resume-to-Job Comparison**: Don't just get a score. Our AI directly compares your resume against specific job descriptions to find exactly where you stand and what you're missing.
- **Integrated Internship & Job Search**: Once analyzed, you can directly search for and find relevant internships and job opportunities that match your improved profile right from the dashboard.
- **Actionable Gap Closure**: We don't just tell you what's missing; we provide a direct career plan to help you acquire the skills needed for your dream role.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Job_Seeker-main
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   From the root folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in `Job_ATS/jobats/backend/`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Project

You can start both frontend and backend simultaneously from the root directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Alternatively, run them separately:

- **Backend**:
  ```bash
  cd Job_ATS/jobats/backend
  node server.js
  ```
- **Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd Job_ATS/jobats/frontend
  npm start
  ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Job_ATS/jobats/frontend`: React application source code.
- `Job_ATS/jobats/backend`: Express API with MongoDB integration.
- `Job_ATS/jobats/backend/models`: Mongoose schemas for Users, Resumes, and Analyses.
- `Job_ATS/jobats/backend/controllers`: Business logic for auth, profile, and analysis.

## 🛡️ Security Note

The backend includes an automatic fallback to an in-memory MongoDB if your Atlas IP is not whitelisted. For production use, ensure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas and use a strong `JWT_SECRET`.
